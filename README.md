# Litho-Examples-Practice
//just for practice ,many functions need to be added.

Some examples show how to create common UI components using Facebook's Litho framework. For Chinese Android developers , I have translated most of the major parts of Litho docs into Chinese,and I will continue to update the rest if I get time. Any questions or discussions are welcomed and I hope I could get someone to work together to complete the translation.Email : jianyifu@gmail.com .
